description:
 This check monitors all switches which are managed and connected to a Fortigate firewall.
 Each existing switch is additionally monitored using piggyback data.
 You need to configure the Checkmk DCD (Dynamice Configuration Deamon) 
 for the Fortigate firewall host.
 The switches are then created as independent hosts in Checkmk.
 A switch switches to the status {crit} when it is no longer connected.

 The switches include the following checks:
  - CPU utilization of the switch
  - Memory utilization of the switch
  - All the Interfaces of the switch
  - POE usage of the switch
  - Uptime of the switch
 
 The special agent is required for this check, 
 which can be configured via “FortiOS”.

discovery:
 One service per switch is created on the Fortigate firewall.
