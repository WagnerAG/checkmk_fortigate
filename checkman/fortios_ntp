 This check monitors the NTP servers of a Fortigate firewall.
 It changes the status to {crit} if there is no NTP server available.
 
 By default, the check also goes to {crit} if the stratum is greater than 4.
 The time deviation is also monitored. 
 The check switches to {warn} at 0.2 seconds and to {crit} at 0.5 seconds.

 All values can be parameterized using a rule.

 The special agent is required for this check, 
 which can be configured via “FortiOS”.
