## Description

This is the repository for the Fortinet Firewall Special Agent. Due to conflicts with the built-in CheckMK checks, the rules are renamed to FortiOS.

### CheckMK Permission Config for API

To create an API token for Checkmk, follow these steps:

1. Create an administrator profile:\
Go to `System` &rarr; `Admin Profiles` &rarr; `Create New`
    - Name: `checkmk-readonly`
    - Permissions: Set all to `Read`
    - Permit usage of CLI diagnostic commands: `False`

2. Create REST API Administrator:\
Go to `System` &rarr; `Administrators` &rarr; `Create New` &rarr; `REST API Administrator`
    - Username: `checkmk`
    - Administrator Profile: `checkmk-readonly` (or how you named it)
    - Virtual Domains: select all VDOMs
    - PKI Group: `False`
    - CORS Allow Origin: `False`
    - Trusted Hosts: `True` &rarr; enter the `IP OF YOUR CHECKMK INSTANCE`

### Configure the special agent

1. Install the plugin via Extensions
2. Search for FortiOS special angent and configure a rule
3. Confirgure the rule for your needs:
    - API Token: `TOKEN YOUR CREATED ABOVE`
    - Port: 8443 is default
    - SSL certificate checking: it's recommended to trust the certificate via CheckMK and not to deactivate the checks!
    - Timeout: you may leave at default value, please increase in case of slow WAN

### DCD Configuration for Network Switches

To have the piggyback data delivered, the DCD must be set up.

Go to `Setup` &rarr; `DCD` (dynamic configuration daemon)
- Title: `local`
- SIte: `cmk`
- Connector type: `Piggyback data`
- Sync interval: `1min`
- Create hosts in: `Main`
- Discovery services during creation: `Selected`

### Configure Inventory Rule

To use the inventory, you have to create a rule.\
Go to `Setup` &rarr; `HW/SW inventory rules` &rarr; `Do hardware/software inventory`\
Specify the settings to fit your needs.


### Switchport Monitoring

To monitor switch ports, the following should be noted:

 - If the `FortiOS Switch Interface Discovery` rule is not configured, all interfaces will be discovered.
 - If the rule is configured, a pattern must be specified for the description.
 - Currently, the description is visible in the service summary output. This should be changed later.
 - Currently, all interface data is output in 'Service Details'. This makes debugging easier.


# Development

For the best development experience use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [Remote Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extension. This maps your workspace into a checkmk docker container giving you access to the python environment and libraries the installed extension has.

## Contribution

See CONTRIBUTING.md

## Special Agent Call

To call the special agent manually, please use this command.
```
 /opt/omd/sites/cmk/bin/python3 agent_fortios.py --api-token <TOKEN> --port 8443 --no-cert-check <HOST_IP>
```

## Directories
