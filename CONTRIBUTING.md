### Development Setup

This project uses Visual Studio Code with a `devcontainer` for development. Follow these steps to get started:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```sh
   https://github.com/WagnerAG/checkmk_fortigate.git
   cd checkmk_fortigate
   ```

2. **Open the project in Visual Studio Code**:
   ```sh
   code .
   ```

3. **Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS)** and select `Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container`. This will build and start the development container.

4. **Install dependencies** (if not already installed in the container):
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Run the tests**:
   ```sh
   pytest
   ```

Run pytest in verbose mode
   ```sh
    pytest -v
   ```

### Style Guide

This project uses [`ruff`](https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff) for linting and code style. To ensure consistency, make sure to run `ruff` before committing your code:

```sh
ruff check .
```

To automatically fix issues:

```sh
ruff check . --fix
```
